## What is in this repo?

This repo provides information on common algorithms, solutions and their time complexity. These algorithms are grouped together as below:

### Math Algorithms
- Calculate the sum of a number up to that number
- Primality
- Fibonacci
- Find the smallest number in an array
- Find the even and odd numbers
- Calculate the sum of an array
- Check is a number is a power of two
- Factorial Algorithm

### Recursion and Dynamic Programming
- Fibonacci (with Recursion)
- Fibonacci (with Recursion and Memoization ie: dynamic programming)

## Tests
Each algorithm group will have tests:
- `math-algorithms.test.js`

To run the tests:
- Install node dependencies `npm i`
- Run tests `npm run test`
