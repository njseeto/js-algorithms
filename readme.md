## What is in this repo?

This repo provides information on common algorithms, solutions, their time and space complexity.

A summary of the algorithms are found [here](summary.md).

These algorithms are grouped together as below:

### [Math Algorithms](math-algorithms)
- Calculate the sum of a number up to that number
- Primality
- Fibonacci
- Find the smallest number in an array
- Find the even and odd numbers
- Calculate the sum of an array
- Check is a number is a power of two
- Factorial Algorithm

### [Recursion and Dynamic Programming](recursion-dynamic)
- Fibonacci (with Recursion)
- Fibonacci (with Recursion and Memoization ie: dynamic programming)

### Search Algorithms
- [Linear Search](search-algorithms/linear-search)
- [Binary Search](search-algorithms/binary-search)

### Sorting Algorithms
- [Bubble Sort](sorting-algorithms/bubble-sort)
- [Quicksort](sorting-algorithms/quicksort)
- [Merge sort](sorting-algorithms/merge-sort)

## Tests
Each algorithm group will have sub-folders that contain:
- Readme explaining the algorithm
- Solution
- Test folder

To run the tests:
- Install node dependencies `npm i`
- Run tests `npm run test`
